# CS50
# CS50 Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to problem sets from Harvard's **CS50: Introduction to Computer Science**. The course dives into foundational topics in computer science and programming, starting with C and progressing to higher-level languages like Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

## ðŸš€ Course Topics

- Algorithms
- Memory Management
- Data Structures
- C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Security and Web Development

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

CS50 is my introduction to computer science, and I'm using this repo to:
- Track my progress
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Build a public record of my learning journey

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- These solutions are my own work.
- I may update them as I revisit or refactor older psets.
